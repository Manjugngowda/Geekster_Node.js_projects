# Binary Search

A simple and efficient implementation of the binary search algorithm in JavaScript. This package allows you to search for an element in a sorted array in logarithmic time \( O(\log n) \).

## Features

- **Efficient Search:** The binary search algorithm reduces the time complexity to \( O(\log n) \), making it much faster than linear search for large datasets.
- **Simple API:** Easy-to-use function that returns the index of the target element or `-1` if not found.
- **Modular:** Can be used as a standalone utility or included in other projects.

## Installation

### Using npm (Node.js)

You can install this package from npm by running:

```bash
npm install binary-search
